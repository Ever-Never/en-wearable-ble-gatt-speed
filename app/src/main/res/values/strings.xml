        This app is used to test GATT transfer speeds for Exposure Notification specific operations.
        One device should be configured as the server and the other as the client.\n\nOn the client
        side, you\'ll scan for the server and when it is found, press the connect button. You can
        then decide to transfer scanned RPIs from the server to the client, or send advertisement
        packets from the client to the server.\n\nTransfer speeds will be measured and output on
        both the client and server for each operation.
